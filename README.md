# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would have made the coffee shop logo animated after the mouse hovers over it, would have made the links bigger with better animation.
The menu section i would have aligned the titles center ex Filter, espresso and baked goods would all be in the center, not left.
recipes i would have hadded a shadow box around the videos and put the titles over the videos centered
book at table i would have also centerd the title ex name. would have had the button have more style to it
over all use better background images for the project
